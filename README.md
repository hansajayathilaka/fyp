# Decentralized Equity Investment Platform

## Introduction
This project aims to address the limitations of existing equity investment platforms by leveraging **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based blockchain architecture**. The solution ensures **scalability, efficiency, and regulatory compliance** with integrated **Know Your Customer (KYC)** processes. Our platform focuses on delivering faster, more secure, and cost-effective solutions for equity markets.

## Objectives
1. Develop a decentralized equity investment platform using DAG-based blockchain.
2. Enhance transaction efficiency and scalability with parallel processing.
3. Implement KYC-compliant identity management while preserving user privacy.
4. Build a secure and resilient ecosystem to address fraud and security vulnerabilities.
5. Document and present a detailed technical and research report.

## Proposed Solution
The platform enables:
- **Companies** to register, verify via KYC, and list equity tokens.
- **Investors** to complete KYC and securely trade tokens.
- **Real-Time Processing**: DAG ensures fast and scalable transaction handling for equity trading.

## Implementation Plan
1. Research DAG-based blockchain systems and decentralized KYC mechanisms.
2. Design and develop a scalable platform architecture.
3. Implement core functionalities, including tokenization and identity management.
4. Test the platform for performance, scalability, and compliance.
5. Deploy and document findings.
